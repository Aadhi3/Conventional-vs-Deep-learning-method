# Conventional-vs-Deep-learning-method
The comprehensive study of traditional Machine learning method versus Deep Learning method on Road lane detection and Facial emotion recognition .
This project focuses on the comparative study of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods like neural networks for two important computer vision tasks: facial emotion detection and road lane detection.
Facial emotion detection is an important application of computer vision that has gained significant attention in recent years. It has various applications such as emotion recognition, security, and marketing. Road lane detection is also a crucial application of computer vision, particularly in the automotive industry, where it is used for autonomous driving.
The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods like neural networks on facial emotion detection and road lane detection tasks. We have used publicly available datasets for both tasks and have implemented several traditional machine learning methods like SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, along with deep learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
The project also includes a comprehensive analysis of the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for each method used. The results of the study demonstrate that deep learning methods outperform traditional machine learning methods for both facial emotion detection and road lane detection tasks.
Overall, this project contributes to the existing research on computer vision by providing a comparative study of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods like neural networks for two critical applications. The project's code and results are available on GitHub for further reference and exploration.
